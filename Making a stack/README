Correct the program as given in class.
Take the stack template as written in class, which uses an array which was developed internally to the class to implement the stack, and make it work correctly with linked-lists to implement the stack (instead of being based upon a dynamic array the stack is now based upon an linked-list). This means that there will be two versions of the templated stack, one which is based upon arrays and one which is based upon a linked-list.
Then convert the linked-list stack so that it inherits from a static singly linked-list base class. (Users of the stack have no need to know how it is implemented.) In other words, split the stack class into two classes: a base class class which is a linked-list and a derived class which is the stack. (NOTE: Pointers of type void will be needed for this!)
You will need to specialize all templates for certain data types, such as C++ strings, C strings, etc..
